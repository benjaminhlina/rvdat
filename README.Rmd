```{r}
library(rvdat)

Download current version of VDAT executable and point `vdat_here` to its location.

Set system location of vdat.exe:
```{r}
vdat_here('inst/vdat.exe')
```

Call VDAT using standard flags:
```{r}
call_vdat('--help')
```

Currently only prints the "0" in the README, but will print full help output in the console.
