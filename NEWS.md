# rvdat 0.3.0

  - Experimental support for Linux systems by wrapping calls to `vdat.exe`
  in a call to [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/). Needs Wine and Winetricks installed,
  (~1.75 GB total!) so more of a bandage rather than an actual implementation.

# rvdat 0.2.0

  - [vdat_here](https://rvdat.obrien.page/reference/vdat_here.html) now looks for
  the vdat executable in the OS-standard installation locations.
  - Miscellaneous test updates to accommodate changes in version 11.0.1 of the 
  vdat executable. See differences here:

  - Update to README as Fathom now installs in `.../Innovasea/Fathom Connect`
  instead of `.../Innovasea/Fathom`.
