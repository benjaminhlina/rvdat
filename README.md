The intent of this package is to provide lightweight R wrapper functions
around Innovasea’s VDAT File Tool for those who are intimidated by the
shell (me) or just want to keep everything in one language (R, also me).

`rvdat` is intended to play nicely with the
[`matos`](https://matos.obrien.page) and
[`otndo`](https://otndo.obrien.page) packages, though full connectivity
and documentation on how to do so is a work in progress. Please reach
out to me at <mike@obrien.page> or open an issue on GitHub if you need
any help.

For similar implementation that has a few more bells and whistles, check
out
[`glatos::vdat_convert`](https://github.com/ocean-tracking-network/glatos/blob/dev/R/util-vdat.r)
in version \>= 0.8.0 of the [glatos
package](https://github.com/ocean-tracking-network/glatos).

## Installation

### Download `vdat.exe`

`rvdat` requires a VDAT executable (`vdat.exe`) in order to work, which
comes packaged in Innovasea’s Fathom Connect software. You can [download
the software
here](https://support.fishtracking.innovasea.com/s/downloads) after
providing your contact details and agreeing to their End User License
Agreement.

![](man/figures/README-fathom_connect_download.png)

Extract and run the installer, paying attention into which directory the
program is installed. On my (Windows) machine, it installs itself into
`C:\Program Files\Innovasea\Fathom`.

``` r
path_to_vdat <- list.files(
  path = "C:/Program Files/Innovasea/Fathom",
  pattern = "^vdat\\.exe$",
  full.names = TRUE
)

path_to_vdat
#> [1] "C:/Program Files/Innovasea/Fathom/vdat.exe"
```

### Install `rvdat`

You can install the most-up-to-date version of this package from
[R-universe](https://mhpob.r-universe.dev/rvdat) or
[GitHub](https://github.com/mhpob/rvdat).

R-universe:

``` r
install.packages(
  "rvdat",
  repos = c(
    "https://mhpob.r-universe.dev",
    "https://cloud.r-project.org"
  )
)
```

GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mhpob/rvdat")
```

## Progress

### To do

- [ ] Sensor values
- [ ] Logging
- [ ] Look for `vdat.exe`

### Completed

- [x] Check VDAT is where you say it is
- Convert VDAT file to
  - [x] CSV
  - [x] folder of CSVs by factor
  - [x] JSON
- [x] Output location
- [x] Time correction
- [x] Inspect content of file
- [x] Create CSV template

### Won’t add (for now)

- [ ] ~~Detection filter~~
  - only implemented for HR3 VDAT files; will implement when there’s a
    file to test
- [ ] ~~Convert multiple VRLs~~
  - Removed from `vdat.exe` in spring 2023. Left to user.
- [ ] ~~Time offset~~
  - Won’t add; subtracts a number of hours from the time without being
    DST-aware.
- [ ] ~~JSON template~~
  - The `json.rxlog` and `vfwp` formats noted in the help documentation
    were for internal testing and not intended to be exposed. (See [this
    issue](https://github.com/mhpob/rvdat/issues/15#issuecomment-2214421397))

## Using the package

Load the package:

``` r
library(rvdat)
```

Set system location of vdat.exe:

``` r
vdat_here(path_to_vdat)
#> ℹ vdat.exe is located at C:/Program Files/Innovasea/Fathom/vdat.exe
```

What version?

``` r
vdat_version()
#> vdat-9.13.2-20240607-7a2e9d-release
```

Convert a VRL to CSV:

``` r
## vdat_to_csv("SOME-VDAT-FILE")
#> ✔ File converted:
#>   C:\Users\darpa2\AppData\Local\Temp\RtmpINUXfp/readme_files/HR2-180 461396
#>   2021-04-20 173145.vdat
#> ℹ File saved in:
#>   C:\Users\darpa2\AppData\Local\Temp\RtmpINUXfp/readme_files/HR2-180 461396
#>   2021-04-20 173145.csv
```

Convert a VRL to a folder of CSVs split by data type:

``` r
## vdat_to_folder("SOME-VDAT-FILE")
#> ✔ File converted:
#>   C:\Users\darpa2\AppData\Local\Temp\RtmpINUXfp/readme_files/HR2-180 461396

## Development notes

If contributing, please use the following general style:

- Begin any function that will call `vdat.exe` with the
  `vdat_loc <- check_vdat_location()` helper function.
- Use the [`sys` package](https://jeroen.r-universe.dev/sys) to send
  commands to `vdat.exe`, usually via `sys::exec_internal`. The “cmd”
  argument can then be `vdat_loc`.
- Create informative messages, warnings, and errors using the [`cli`
  package](https://cli.r-lib.org/).
- In summary:

``` r
a_new_wrapper <- function(some_command) {
  vdat_loc <- check_vdat_location()

  sys::exec_internal(
    vdat_loc,
    args = some_command
  )

  cli::cli_alert_success("Woohoo!!")
}
```
