We often want to extract the environmental data that some of our receivers log. You can do this by going into Innovasea's VUE or Fathom Connect programs and clicking a bunch of buttons, or you can do it programmatically and reproducibly by combining `matos` and [`rvdat`](https://rvdat.obrien.page).


``` r
library(matos)
library(rvdat)
```

## Download the data

If you're an ACT member, log into your MATOS account. If you're not, we'll skip to the next section and assume you already have your files ready.


``` r
matos_login()
#> ! Please log in.
#> v Login successful!
```

Next, tell `rvdat` the location of the `vdat.exe` executable (check out the [`rvdat` documentation](https://rvdat.obrien.page) for more information on this).


``` r
vdat_here()
```

Using `matos`, I'm going to find the VDAT files associated with the [Mid-Bay Chesapeake Backbone array](https://matos.asascience.com/project/detail/161). Note that things like temperature and tilt are logged within the VRL/VDAT files, and so will be under the "detections" file type.


``` r
detection_files <- list_project_files(
  project = "UMCES Chesapeake Backbone, Mid-Bay",
  file_type = "detections"
)

head(detection_files)
#>   project                  file_type upload_date

#> 7 https://matos.asascience.com/projectfile/download/13868
#> 8 https://matos.asascience.com/projectfile/download/13867
```

I'll download the first file into a temporary directory.


``` r
get_project_file(
  url = detection_files$url[1],
  out_dir = tempdir()
)
#> 
#> -- Downloading files ---------------------------------------------------
#> v File(s) saved to:
#>    C:\Users\darpa2\AppData\Local\Temp\RtmpusjJ5z\VR2AR_551436_20240805_1.vrl
#> [1] "C:\\Users\\darpa2\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpusjJ5z\\VR2AR_551436_20240805_1.vrl"

vrl_file <- list.files(tempdir(), pattern = "vrl$", full.names = T)
```

## Convert VRL using `rvdat`

Now, I'll use `rvdat::vdat_to_folder` to convert that file into a folder of CSV files, each one representing one data type.


``` r
vdat_to_folder(
  vrl_file,
  outdir = tempdir()
)

There are quite a few files in there, but for this we're going to focus on the temperature records stored in `TEMP.csv`.


``` r
list.files(tempdir(), pattern = "fathom-split", full.names = T) |>

bwt_file <- list.files(tempdir(), pattern = "TEMP", full.names = T, recursive = T)
```

## Read it into R

Let's read in the data.


``` r
read.csv(bwt_file)
#> Error in read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote = quote, : more columns than column names
```

An error, oh no! Let's see what's causing it.


``` r
read.csv(bwt_file,
  header = FALSE,
  nrows = 5
)

Ah, the data doesn't really start until the second row. Skip the first one and take a look.


``` r
bwt <- read.csv(
  bwt_file,
  skip = 1
)

head(bwt)

Great! The data are in. I'm going to clean up the names a little bit and convert the time column from a character string to POSIX time.


``` r
names(bwt) <- gsub("[_\\.]", "", tolower(names(bwt)))

names(bwt)
#> [1] "tempdesc"        "devicetimeutc"   "time"           
#> [4] "timeoffseth"     "timecorrections" "model"          
#> [7] "serialnumber"    "ambientdegc"     "internaldegc"

bwt$devicetimeutc <- as.POSIXct(bwt$devicetimeutc,
  tz = "UTC",
  format = "%F %T"
)

head(bwt)
#>   tempdesc       devicetimeutc time timeoffseth timecorrections
#> 1     TEMP 2024-03-21 20:00:00   NA          NA              NA
#> 2     TEMP 2024-03-21 21:00:00   NA          NA              NA
#> 3     TEMP 2024-03-21 22:00:00   NA          NA              NA

```

## See what we've got

Now that we have our time series, let's see what it looks like!


``` r
plot(ambientdegc ~ devicetimeutc,
  data = bwt,
  type = "l"
)
```

![](figures/rvdat-bwt-1.png)

## Other variables

We can pull out other variables in a similar manner. Take, for example, receiver tilt, located in `ATTITUDE.csv`.


``` r
env_import <- function(file) {
  hold <- list.files(
    tempdir(),
    pattern = file,
    full.names = T,
    recursive = T
  ) |>
    read.csv(skip = 1)

  names(hold) <- gsub("[_\\.]", "", tolower(names(hold)))

  hold$devicetimeutc <- as.POSIXct(hold$devicetimeutc,
    tz = "UTC",
    format = "%F %T"
  )

  hold
}

tilt <- env_import("ATTITUDE")

plot(tiltdeg ~ devicetimeutc, data = tilt, type = "l")
```

![](figures/rvdat-tilt-1.png)

Depth, in `DEPTH.csv`:


``` r
depth <- env_import("DEPTH")

plot(depthm ~ devicetimeutc, data = depth)
```

![](figures/rvdat-depth-1.png)

Battery, in `BATTERY.csv`:


``` r
battery <- env_import("BATTERY")

plot(batteryvoltagev ~ devicetimeutc, data = battery)
```

![](figures/rvdat-battery-1.png)

Noise, which is actually in the diagnostic file `DIAG.csv`:


``` r
diagnostics <- env_import("DIAG")

plot(noisemeanmv ~ devicetimeutc, data = diagnostics)
```

![](figures/rvdat-noise-1.png)
Hourly summaries of pings and detections are also in the diagnositc file:


``` r
plot(ppmdetections ~ devicetimeutc, data = diagnostics)
```

![](figures/rvdat-detections-1.png)

``` r
plot(ppmpings ~ devicetimeutc, data = diagnostics)
```

![](figures/rvdat-detections-2.png)

But are really located in `DET.csv`.


``` r
dets <- env_import("DET")

head(dets[, ])
#>   detdesc       devicetimeutc time timeoffseth timecorrections    model

These data were gleaned from a particular receiver programmed in a particular way -- note that many of the data fields are empty! Depending on the receiver, how you programmed it, and the arguments you passed to `rvdat` (time correction, anyone?), your split CSV could look rather different.
