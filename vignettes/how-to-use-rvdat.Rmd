## Getting started


```r
library(rvdat)
```

First, as we should always do when beginning a `rvdat` workflow, we tell R where our `vdat.exe` is located. Mine is within an installed version of [Fathom Connect](https://support.fishtracking.innovasea.com/s/downloads).


```r
vdat_here("c:/program files/innovasea/fathom/vdat.exe")
#> â„¹ vdat.exe is located at c:/program files/innovasea/fathom/vdat.exe
```

Next, let's download a sample VRL file from the `glatos` package using `utils::download.file`. I'll be keeping everything in a temporary directory just to keep tidy.


```r
td <- file.path(
  tempdir(),
  "vignette"
)

dir.create(
  td
)

download.file(
  url = file.path(
    "https://github.com/ocean-tracking-network/glatos/raw/dev/inst/extdata",
    "detection_files_raw/VR2AR_546310_20190613_1.vrl"
  ),
  destfile = file.path(
    td,
    "VR2AR_546310_20190613_1.vrl"
  ),
  mode = "wb",
  quiet = TRUE
)
```

## Converting a VRL to a CSV

Now that we have a VRL to play with, let's convert it to a csv. It's pretty quick with `vdat_to_csv`.


```r
vdat_to_csv(file.path(td, "VR2AR_546310_20190613_1.vrl"),
  outdir = td
)

list.files(td, pattern = "VR2AR")
#> [1] "VR2AR_546310_20190613_1.csv" "VR2AR_546310_20190613_1.vrl"
```
`vdat` is very respectful of your data in that it never overwrites files that exist in the same directory. It'll just tack on a time stamp to the name of the newly-exported file.


```r
vdat_to_csv(file.path(td, "VR2AR_546310_20190613_1.vrl"),
  outdir = td
)

list.files(td, pattern = "VR2AR")
#> [1] "VR2AR_546310_20190613_1.csv"                          
#> [2] "VR2AR_546310_20190613_1.vrl"                          
#> [3] "VR2AR_546310_20190613_1[20240106-16-02-49-913633].csv"
```

## Converting a VRL to a CSV folder

As outlined in `vignette('vdat-data-structure')`, the flat CSV exported via `vdat_to_csv` is a mush-together of all available data types in the VDAT file. `vdat.exe` can split these into a folder of files according to data type for you, accessible using `rvdat` via `vdat_to_folder` or `vdat_call(c('convert', '--format=csv.fathom.split', 'FILENAME'))`.


```r
vdat_to_folder(
  file.path(td, "VR2AR_546310_20190613_1.vrl"),
  outdir = td
)

list.dirs(td, full.names = F, recursive = F)
#> [1] "VR2AR_546310_20190613_1.csv-fathom-split"

list.files(
  list.dirs(td, full.names = T, recursive = F)
)
#>  [1] "ATTITUDE.csv"         "BATTERY.csv"          "CFG_CHANNEL.csv"     
#>  [4] "CFG_TRANSMITTER.csv"  "CLOCK_REF.csv"        "DATA_SOURCE_FILE.csv"
#>  [7] "DEPTH.csv"            "DET.csv"              "DIAG.csv"            
#> [10] "DIAG_FAST.csv"        "EVENT_INIT.csv"       "EVENT_OFFLOAD.csv"   
#> [13] "HEALTH_VR2AR.csv"     "TEMP.csv"
